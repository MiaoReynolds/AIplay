# About This Site

This little site is a collection of side projects I’ve built during spare moments — some are for entry-level educational purposes, others are simply driven by curiosity. There’s no grand plan here, but I do intend to keep moving... somewhere. Not necessarily forward, because frankly, there's no clear direction — just a desire to see where things might lead and what fun discoveries we might uncover along the way.

If I were to loosely sketch a plan, it might look like this: start with simple things like blinking LEDs or tiny desk lights, and gradually escalate toward something more... cinematic — maybe even “Terminator”-grade tech. I’m not promising we’ll ever get there, but I’m pretty sure the journey will be worth it.
