# About This Site

**AIplay** is where AI meets the physical world. We build practical solutions that bridge intelligent automation, embedded hardware, and enterprise workflows — turning ideas into deployable systems.

## What We Do

### 🤖 Intelligent Automation

We design and deploy **n8n-based workflow hubs** that connect large language models, APIs, and business tools — running 24/7 without human intervention. From AI-powered selfie booths to automated student grading systems, our workflows solve real operational problems.

### 🔧 Hardware × AI Integration

From **Raspberry Pi** edge devices to **ESP32** embedded interfaces, we prototype controllers that respond to AI decisions in the physical world. Our projects span OLED-based productivity timers, robotic arms, and quadruped robots — all with working code and schematics.

### 🎓 Applied AI Education

Case-study-driven tutorials covering **vibe coding**, AIGC prompt engineering, and end-to-end automation. Every concept comes with a live demo, working code, or a hands-on build guide — designed for practitioners, not theorists.

---

## Our Approach

We take a **build-first** approach: every concept on this site ships with working code, hardware schematics, or a live demo. We believe the fastest way to understand AI's potential is to see it run — in a workflow, on a screen, or controlling a robot arm.
