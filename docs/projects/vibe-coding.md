# Vibe Coding

A short intro to **Vibe Coding**: coding by describing what you want in natural language and letting AI assistants generate or edit code, so you focus on intent and flow rather than typing every line.

## 🛠 Tools

Representative tools and environments often used in vibe coding:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| <img src="https://openai.com/favicon.ico" width="24" height="24" alt="OpenAI"> **Codex** | OpenAI’s code model (e.g. powering GitHub Copilot); translates natural language and context into code. |
| <img src="https://cursor.com/favicon.ico" width="24" height="24" alt="Cursor"> **Cursor** | AI-first code editor with inline generation, chat, and editor actions built around your codebase. |
| **Antigravity** | Lightweight, “floating” flow: stay in the zone with minimal context switching and AI-assisted edits. |

## 📖 What is Vibe Coding?

**Vibe Coding** is a style of programming where you work mainly by:

- **Describing intent** in plain language (comments, chat, or prompts) instead of writing every line by hand.
- **Iterating with AI** that suggests or edits code (autocomplete, inline generation, or refactors) so you steer rather than type.
- **Keeping flow** — less time on syntax and boilerplate, more on design, logic, and “vibe” of what you’re building.

You stay in the flow; the machine handles a lot of the typing and routine implementation.
